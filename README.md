# Junior QA Portfolio

Welcome to my QA portfolio!   
Here I collect examples of my work as a Quality Assurance Engineer, including test cases, bug reports, checklists, and small projects.  
My goal is to demonstrate practical QA skills and approach to testing.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **/test-cases** – examples of functional and UI test cases  
- **/bug-reports** – bug reports written in professional format (Steps → Actual → Expected)  
- **/checklists** – checklists for different features (smoke, regression, UI/UX)  
- **/test-docs** – additional docs (Postman collections, reports, diagrams, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- Manual testing (web, mobile)  
- Bug reporting (Jira-style, GitHub Issues)  
- Test design techniques (checklists, test cases, boundary values, equivalence classes)  
- GitHub for documentation & version control
